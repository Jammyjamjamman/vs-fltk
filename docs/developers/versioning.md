## Versioning

At this time, this repository is only available as a [meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) package.  
Releases are tagged on the repo, with `master` as the main development branch.  
Semantic versioning will be followed after `v1.0.0`.  
Before that, any release can and will have breaking changes.

Versions ending with an **odd** revision number are meant for proper releases, while **even** numbers are only for in-dev stages.
